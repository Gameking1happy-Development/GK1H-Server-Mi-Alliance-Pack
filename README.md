# Details
Modpack for server, includes client, (config+mods files, and Modrinth profile) server, (config+mods files, and Modrinth profile) and txt file with information to join the server. 
# First Install
Use the Modrinth profile, if you want to use a different launcher download the config and mods folders and put them in the folder for the Minecraft profile. Server is already added to list.
# Update
Currently, the only way to update without fully resetting data is to replace the config and mods folder, though this resets anything that mods save in config, to prevent this you could merge the old and new config, however, if any mods were removed, it is recommended to check if they had config data, and also any other data, and delete that data.
## NOTICE!
**DO NOT UPDATE MODS USING THE MODRINTH UPDATE FEATURE, IT COULD BREAK OR PREVENT YOU FROM PLAYING ON THE SERVER!!!**
