# Details
Modpack for server, includes client, (config and mods files, and Modrinth profile) server, (config and mods files, and Modrinth profile), txt file with information to join the server, image used for the Modrinth profiles, and a version with a smaller pixel size used for the server icon.
# Note About Server Pack
The server pack does not have default settings, and just simply is not at all recommended for use as a client.
# First Install
Use the Modrinth profile, or, if you want to use a different launcher, download the config and mods folders and put them in the folder for the Minecraft profile. Server is already added to list. (Client pack only.)
# Update
To update, replace the old mods folder with the new one, then, find the folders/files that are in the new config, and replace the ones that are in the old config with those. Removing other config files will possibly delete mod settings, but the mods will create needed config files on launch, so you can if you are fine with resetting your settings to default, or if they currently are default.
## NOTICE!
**DO NOT UPDATE MODS USING THE MODRINTH UPDATE FEATURE, IT COULD BREAK OR PREVENT YOU FROM PLAYING ON THE SERVER!!!**
