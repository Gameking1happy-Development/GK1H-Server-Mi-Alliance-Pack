# Details
Modpack for server, includes client, (config and mods files in a .zip, and Modrinth profile) server, (config and mods files in a .zip, and Modrinth profile), and some more stuff.
# Note About Server Pack 
The server pack does not have default settings, and just simply is not at all recommended for use as a client.
# First Install
## Modrinth
Use the Modrinth profile, server is already added to list. (Client pack only.)
## CurseForge
Use the link in the readme.md as mentioned in the header "Links".
## Other Launcher
Download the config and mods folders and put them in the folder for the Minecraft profile.
# Update
## Modrinth Via Private Modpack Download
If there is a later version, there will be an update button. Please note that the GK1H server only uses release versions, so do not download alpha or beta versions for a profile used to join the server.
## CurseForge
Similar to Modrinth, CurseForge has a simple way to update. Please note that the GK1H server only uses release versions, so do not download alpha or beta versions for a profile used to join the server.
## Other Launchers/Modrinth Via Downloadable Profile
Replace the old mods folder with the new one, then, find the folders/files that are in the new config, and replace the ones that are in the old config with those. Removing other config files will possibly delete mod settings, but the mods will create needed config files on launch, so you can if you are fine with resetting your settings to default, or if they currently are default.
## NOTICE!
**DO NOT UPDATE MODS USING ANY AUTOMATIC UPDATES FOR INDIVIDUAL MODS OR MANUALLY DO SO WITH FILES NOT FROM THE MODPACK, IT COULD BREAK OR PREVENT YOU FROM PLAYING ON THE SERVER!!!**
