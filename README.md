# Details
Modpack for server, includes client, (config and mods files, and Modrinth profile) server, (config and mods files, and Modrinth profile), txt file with information to join the server, image used for the Modrinth profiles, and a version with a smaller pixel size used for the server icon.
# Note About Server Pack
The server pack does not have default settings, and just simply is not at all recommended for use as a client.
# First Install
Use the Modrinth profile, if you want to use a different launcher, download the config and mods folders and put them in the folder for the Minecraft profile. Server is already added to list. (Client pack only.)
# Update
Currently, the only way to update without fully resetting data is to replace the config and mods folder, though this resets anything that mods save in config, to prevent this you could merge the old and new config, however, if any mods were removed, it is recommended to check if they had config data, and also any other data, and delete that data.
## NOTICE!
**DO NOT UPDATE MODS USING THE MODRINTH UPDATE FEATURE, IT COULD BREAK OR PREVENT YOU FROM PLAYING ON THE SERVER!!!**
